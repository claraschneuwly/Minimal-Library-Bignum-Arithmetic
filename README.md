# Minimal-Library-Bignum-Arithmetic

Final project for the course Logics and Proofs (CSE203) at Ecole Polytechnique.

Minimal library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic on Coq (formal proofs management language).

While most ALU hardware deal only with 32 or 64 bit numbers, and several modern programming languages have built-in support for bignums, we are interested in the set of techniques used to manipulate numbers (mainly integers or rational) of arbitrary sizes in a computer program.
